Chapter 1<p>
<p>
Four score, and 7 years ago ... Well, I mean in 1987….. a child was born.<p>
<p>
The earth rattled as his feet came out first.  Electricity filled the room, kind of like when The Rock walked down the aisle, as the lights flickered on and off, on and off, as his body moved throughout the womb.  Fortunately, his mother, who had refused the epidural, was bewildered, as he was being born slowly and painlessly.<p>
<p>
The doctors looked on in amazement, as, like the birth of Jay Z, his mother was feeling no pain.  The mother, Ms. Johnson, pushed with all her might, as the child birthing process continued. <p>
<p>
Finally, as she got toward the head of the baby, she began to pass out.  She gave one final push, and out popped the child; he flew up in the air, like the top popped off a shaken soda, and into his father's arms.<p>
<p>
However, although this was a joyous occasion, the child's mother had passed during the birth, or so the doctors thought.  As they began to “wheel her out”, the baby began to hum a sweet song.<p>
<p>
                &quot;Dummmmmmmm, Dummmmmmm, Mummmmmmmmmm, Mummmm&quot;<p>
<p>
The melody was a sound like none had ever heard before, as it had stopped everyone from doing what they were doing.  Then without warning the child, raised his right hand, and his mother levitated off of the bed, the lights fell in the hospital went black, and as a gasp was heard that would have shocked any person who had ears, or like someone who was in The Omen.<p>
<p>
Mrs. Johnson had been revived ...by the baby.<p>
<p>
&quot;Oh it's a miracle&quot;, they (they being the doctors, nurses, and innocent bystanders) shouted.<p>
<p>
She grabbed the baby, held him dear to her heart, and said &quot;My Rock, I'll hold you close forever.&quot;<p>
<p>
The baby looked up at her big blue eyes, and smiled.<p>
<p>
&quot;What are you going to name the baby&quot; a nurse asked.<p>
<p>
&quot;Stone, my dear&quot; she said, &quot;Stone Richard.&quot;<p>
<p>
Mr. Johnson instantly heard this and was satisfied.  Like he just ate 5 pieces of chocolate mousse cake.<p>
<p>
A nurse asked, &quot;why Stone Richard?&quot;<p>
<p>
She replied, &quot;Stone like the rock that he is to me, and Richard for Richard the Lionheart.&quot;  <p>
<p>
The nurse smiled, she had never heard a more beautiful name.  And secretly, she had no fuckin clue who Richard the Lionheart was.<p>
(Richard the Lionheart was a great military leader of ancient times).<p>
And that was the day Stone Dick was born.<p>
<p>
Chapter 2<p>
<p>
Like most mortal men, Stone Richard grew up into a beautiful baby boy. Unlike most mortal, however, Stone Richard, or as he was increasingly becoming known, Stone Dick, was ready to change the world. Every hero needs his first test, and luckily for Stone Dick, he didn't have to wait long for that. Stone Dick attended Dr. Dave Middle School, (only billionaires can name a school with just their first name) and that is where he met his first enemy. <p>
Otto Von Jamstein was a rough and tumble type of kid, even for a 6th grader. He smoked cigarettes AND salmon, which is a very impressive feat for someone to pull off before puberty. While Stone Dick was on his way to becoming a legend, he was still quite unassuming at a young age. Otto, on the other hand, was a bully. The only thing Stone Dick hated more than condoms was bully's. While most kids would let Otto take their lunch money, Stone Dick was not most kids. <p>
On one beautiful fall day, Otto decided he was going to prove a point, and set his sights on Stone Dick. On this specific day, Stone was wearing his favorite outfit: jeans with a jean jacket. Some may say that Stone Dick existed in a simpler time when people appreciated jeans and jean jackets, but I'm here to tell you that jean jackets are always in style. Stone was always confident, but when he was wearing his jean/jean jacket combo, he was pretty much unstoppable. Unfortunately for Otto, he picked the wrong day to mess with a God. Otto approached Stone Dick and immediately tried intimidating him. <p>
<p>
&quot;Give me your lunch money, punk!&quot; exclaimed Otto <p>
<p>
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; said Stone Dick<p>
<p>
 &quot;What're you deaf? I said give me your lunch money, punk!&quot; <p>
<p>
Now this is where Otto made his first and only mistake. Stone Dick, in addition to being a legend who saved his mother immediately after being born, was also a huge proponent for deaf rights. Back in the day, deaf people weren't allowed to vote, but thanks to the efforts of Stone Dick, they finally became accepted members of society. <p>
<p>
(Stone Dick stares a hole through Otto)<p>
<p>
 &quot;I told myself I wouldn't get my favorite jean jacket dirty, but you just pissed off the wrong Dick.&quot;   Stone, doesn’t use vulgar language, and only when he gets mad does he refer to himself as a “dick”.<p>
<p>
The earth began to rattle. The ground underneath them began to crack. The skies opened up, and a gale force wind swept through the playground, swooping up Otto and tossing him 500 miles into the sky. Stone Dick had vanquished his first bully, but even though Otto was nowhere to be seen, Stone had a feeling this wouldn't be the last time he and Otto clashed...<p>
<p>
Chapter 3<p>
<p>
Kindergarten was a contaminated place according to Stone Dick.  6th grade may have looked tough, but kindergarten was when he met the school shooter.<p>
<p>
All Stone was thinking about today was candy.  Now, when it comes to Sour Patch kids, its an orgasm of the mouth for Stone Dick.  Stone Dick, loved sour patch kids.<p>
<p>
One day, he was playing tag in the schoolyard with a few friends, when he noticed a white van parked adjacent to the school.  Stone Dick, even at 6, had keen awareness and was very sharp, sort of like Bruce Willis.  Bruce Willis credits Stone Dick with &quot;Yippee-Kaye-Yay!&quot; And his ultimate success in the Die Hard Saga, but that's a story for another time.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick noticed the van was strange.  Soon after out popped a child.  We won’t say the color of the child, he could have been an Aryan skinhead or a Somalian Pirate, this isn’t a racist book.  <p>
<p>
He didn’t know this child, and Stone Dick knew everyone.  He decided to approach the child from the strange van.<p>
<p>
Suddenly the child turned around with an Ak-47.  Stone Dick had keen awareness like Bruce Lee.  He leapt to his feet and charged at the kid.<p>
<p>
The kid began to spray bullets at Stone Dick.  He was shocked someone was charging him so he missed.<p>
The kids in the schoolyard ran to his teacher, Ms. Applegate.<p>
<p>
“Nooooooooooooooo, Stone!” yelled Ms. Applegate from afar.  Her first name was ironically Christina.<p>
<p>
In one swift punch Stone Dick hit the kid in the nose and he dropped the AK 47.  He subdued the kid, who began to cry and said “they made me do it.”  <p>
<p>
Suddenly Stone recognized the kid, as little Johnny McDougal from the back of his class.  <p>
<p>
“No More Bullying” yelled Stone Dick at the top of his lungs, which to the kids of the school sounded like the words of God.<p>
<p>
As for the van, apparently, Johnny had driven his estranged fathers van to school in hopes to kill all the people that bullied him.  Stone thwarted his plans and saved the day.  He knew his job was not yet over.<p>
<p>
<p>
Chapter 4<p>
<p>
By this point it’s well known that Stone Dick was no mortal man, but during his childhood, he still had to play by some of the rules. One of those rules was one of the more painstaking experiences in life:  getting your driving license. The DMV joins the STD as one of those three letter acronyms that really suck the life out of you. Stone Dick hated STDs, and he also hated the DMV, but the latter was a necessary part of living life. Not wanting to intimidate his driving instructor (if it was a man) or force the instructor to have sex with him (if it was a woman), Stone Dick decided leave the jean/jean jacket outfit on the shelf and dress casual for his driving license test. Little did he know that this minor move would come in handy later on.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick’s driver’s license test just so happened to land on a beautiful fall day; the leaves were floating around, the squirrels were having sex and the smell of maple syrup engulfed the air. Stone Dick walked the 40 miles from his home to the DMV and met his driver, the vivacious Veronica Talladaston. Veronica was a beautiful woman in every way: seductive eyes, a killer smile and an ass that could stop traffic on The Long Island Expressway. Lord only knows how she became a driving instructor, but on this day, Stone Dick wasn’t complaining. She went over the rules and they began to walk to the vehicle that Stone Dick would be driving.<p>
<p>
“I don’t normally say things like this, but I hope you don’t mind me saying this Ms. Talladaston, but you’re a beautiful woman”, said Stone Dick.<p>
<p>
“I don’t mind at all. You’re actually very sweet. What did you say your name was again?”<p>
<p>
“Stone Di…Johnson” replied Stone Dick. “Stone Johnson”.<p>
<p>
“That is a very lovely name” remarked Veronica. “A strong name for a strong boy.”<p>
<p>
It was clear from the very beginning that Stone Dick and Veronica would be making sweet, sweet love to each other, but first, there was business to handle. <p>
<p>
Stone Dick got behind the wheel and the rest tooverare of itself. Blinker before a turn? Check. Slowing down at a yellow light? Double Check. Parallel Parking? Let’s just put it this way: Stone Dick was as good at parallel parking as R. Kelly is at peeing on underage girls. The driving test was quickly over, and as expected, Veronica passed Stone Dick with flying colors.<p>
<p>
As Stone Dick went to leave, Veronica pulled him aside and admitted to him all her deepest and darkest secrets. Seconds turned into minutes turned into hours, and some of the stuff Veronica was saying was some seriously messed up shit. Stone Dick finally put his finger to her lips and told her that she didn’t need to speak anymore, and that he knew what he had to to next. As Veronica whispered “Do me, Stone Dick”, Stone slowly leaned over to kiss her. Before he could do that, Stone Dick noticed an elderly lesbian couple crossing the street. <p>
<p>
You might be saying to yourself “how did Stone Dick know they were lesbians?” <p>
<p>
Well Stone Dick has a very rare and useless sixth sense which allows him to spot a lesbian or lesbians from as far as 5 miles away. Fortunately for these lesbians, on this day, his sixth sense was not useless. <p>
<p>
As the lesbians were crossing the street, Stone Dick also noticed a bus flying through the intersection with no plan to slow down. Stone Dick tossed Veronica aside, ran into the street, tucked the elderly lesbians under his arms and ran them to safety just as the bus sped by.<p>
<p>
The elderly lesbians were noticeably shaken up, and as they thanking Stone Dick, his attention was once again diverted to the bus, but this time, he saw something he never expected to see. On the back of the speeding bus was a cross, accompanied by a bumper sticker on the back window that stated ‘Honk if you love Jesus’. Stone Dick saved these wonderful elderly lesbians from their most hated rivals: the Catholic Church. The war between homosexuals and the Catholic Church has been going on for ages, and with one fast thinking move, Stone Dick chose his side. No elderly lesbians were getting run over today. Not on Stone Dick’s watch. Thankfully for the lesbians, Stone Dick did not wear his infamous jean/jean jacket combo, because although it looks fantastic, it is not the proper material for a heroic act such as this. <p>
<p>
Stone Dick kissed each lesbian on the forehead and sent them on their way, and walked back across the street to a waiting Veronica Talladaston. Stone Dick screamed “cover your eyes<p>
children!” as he and Veronica went on to make love for several hours, right outside the DMV. <p>
<p>
I guess that place isn’t so bad after all.<p>
<p>
Chapter 5<p>
<p>
As stated before, Stone Dick was a God in bed, so much so that when you normally refer to a god, it is in lowercase letters - when referring to Stone Dick it must be capitalized - or he will come to your house.  You don't want Stone Dick to ever come to your house - uninvited that is.<p>
<p>
According to the legend of man, what makes a man a man is when he makes a beautiful women orgasm. In some cultures, specifically America, it is called &quot;Conquering the beast,&quot; because it will make any women quiet down.  However, the true question is:  What makes a woman a woman?<p>
<p>
Stone Dick wasn't always doing large heroic things; he was a common man who tried to have common friends, who smoked a lot of fucking pot.  Stone Dick had been smoking pot since he was 4.  Now at age 17, he met Snoop Dogg and Willie Nelson in Los Angeles, California.  Ironically, this is the city of angels, but angels can be so superficial.  Stone, having a natural hero-like appeal to him, sat down next to Mr. Dogg [Lion] and Willie and began to &quot;shoot the shit.&quot;  As they smoked, all of their eyes began to become more and more Chinese-looking or “Chink” per say…  <p>
<p>
The waiter came to the table, and asked, &quot;Do you need to get higher, Sir?&quot;<p>
<p>
Willie had already passed out on the table.  Pot from the Netherlands is much more potent than that of America.  <p>
<p>
Snoop glanced at Stone Dick.  <p>
Stone Dick glanced right back.<p>
&quot;We'll have the Ultra Haze times Sour Diesel times Magic Skunk,&quot; replied Stone Dick.  Snoop's jaw dropped.<p>
<p>
&quot;We don't have any...&quot; Stone Dick's chinky eyes opened at the waiter. &quot;Any...Let me go downstairs.&quot;  Stone Dick nodded.<p>
<p>
As the waiter walked away, Stone Dick turned to Snoop, and said &quot;See man, that's where they keep the good stuff - downstairs.&quot;<p>
<p>
Snoop gave a small little chuckle.  He could barely breathe or see, he was so high.<p>
<p>
As they brought out the UHSDMS, Snoop noticed a little girl crying outside.  Now Snoop, although a gangsta ass motherfucker, has a soft spot for children as we all know.  He got up, and went outside; he walked up to the child.<p>
<p>
&quot;What's wizzle-wrong child&quot; asked Snoop.  <p>
<p>
&quot;My kitty is stuck in the tree!  She can't get down.&quot;<p>
<p>
Snoop looked up at the tall tree.  It looked so much taller now that he was high.  It looked like such an impossible climb.  <p>
<p>
Stone, who had told Snoop he would be out in a second because he had to take a ninja pee, walked outside.<p>
<p>
&quot;What the problem is?&quot;  Stone asked, in his Martin Lawrence impression voice.  Snoop looked around and said &quot;Where's my nigga, Martin?&quot;<p>
<p>
&quot;That was me Snoop,&quot; Stone replied.  &quot;I was just making a funny.&quot;<p>
<p>
Snoop was bewildered, he swore he heard Martin, but realized that Stone Dick was just that damn good.<p>
<p>
&quot;What's the problem little girl&quot; asked Stone Dick.<p>
<p>
&quot;My kitty is stuck in the tree.&quot;  replied the little girl.<p>
<p>
&quot;It's too high to climb,&quot; Snoop chuckled.  &quot;Ha, high, get it?&quot;  He went to nudge Stone Dick.<p>
<p>
&quot;Shhhhh Snoop not in front of the kid,&quot; said Stone Dick.<p>
<p>
Snoop obliged and looked back at the tree.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick took a step back and kicked the tree, rather hard.  It shook violently, and the kitty began to fall out of the tree.<p>
<p>
As the kitty fell, Snoop saw it, grabbed the kitty out of mid air and handed him to the child.<p>
<p>
&quot;Oh Bermuda!&quot;  the child exclaimed.  <p>
<p>
&quot;Bermuda?&quot;  Thought Snoop and Stone.  They looked at each other, it sounded like a nice vacation spot. <p>
<p>
As they looked at each other, Stone, who had a keen eye for breasts, was alerted.  As he glanced to his left, he saw the 6 pairs of double D's running towards Snoop, the child, and himself.  They were screaming in unison, &quot;Kasey, Bermuda! Kasey, Bermuda!&quot;<p>
<p>
They approached Stone and Snoop.  There breasts jiggling in bikinis, their black hair glistening in the Sun, and all three of their blue eye gleaming.  <p>
<p>
&quot;You saved my sister, and Bermuda; how can we ever repay you?&quot;  harmonized the three large breasted supermodel triplets.<p>
<p>
&quot;No repayment necessary, Ma'am's&quot;.  Stone Dick was the only man on earth who could pluralize the word &quot;Ma'am&quot; and make women melt.<p>
<p>
Snoop looked at Stone.  The models looked at Snoop and he and Stone Dick said in harmony, like it was contagious, said &quot;Cheeba?&quot;<p>
<p>
The models replied to Snoop's amazement, &quot;For Shizzle&quot; said the first model.<p>
&quot;Dizzle&quot; said the second.<p>
&quot;My Nizzle&quot; said the third.<p>
<p>
Snoop smiled.  That was the day Snoop and Stone saved the day in Los Angeles, and well, had his way with some supermodels, while Willie Nelson laid passed out on the table and never moved.<p>
<p>
That's how you get high, according to Stone Dick.<p>
<p>
Chapter 6<p>
<p>
The ASVAB test, which unfortunately does not stand for Ass Sex Vagina Ass Boobies, is a tedious test.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick was not fan of tedious things, but he loved his parents and obliged them by taking the test.<p>
<p>
The ASVAB test is made up of your scores in four critical areas -- Arithmetic Reasoning, Word<p>
Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension and Mathematics Knowledge. Now Stone Dick was extremely proficient in all of these areas, especially paragraph comprehension. Some even called him the Stephen Hawking of paragraph comprehension, minus the talking wheelchair. But Stone Dick could not have been more interested in taking this test if it was covered in human shit. This is the same man who saved his mother from certain death as an infant, saved an elderly lesbian couple from the Catholic Church and saved a kitten from a tree while high on marijuana. The ASVAB test just wasn’t going to cut it.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick didn’t study for the test, and in fact, on the eve of the ASVAB, he went out with his friend, Harry Sketchles. They ate, they laughed, and they had sex with so many women that there was literally no bodily fluids left in their body. Stone Dick got to bed around 5am, with the test scheduled for 730am.<p>
<p>
He arrived, hungover, and completed the test in a record 17 minutes. The military generals on site scoffed at this record breaking performance, and each of them knew Stone Dick was not ‘military material’. How wrong they were. A few days after the test, a representative from every major criminal task force in the world showed up at Stone Dick’s front door. There were so many law enforcement officials there, you would have thought a black man had clapped his hands too loud in public.<p>
<p>
The officials were there for one reason and one reason only: Stone Dick had the highest score in the history of the ASVAB test. CIA, DEA, military, Black Ops, Navy Seals, NASA, Banana Republic; think of any big name cooperation and they were at Stone Dick’s doorstep. Stone Dick did not particularly care for the Banana Republic, so they were unfortunately told to leave rather quickly. When you think about it, they probably shouldn’t have been there in the first place, but we live in a crazy world.<p>
<p>
 Every major agency wanted Stone Dick to be apart of their team, and at this point in the story, you can see why. Mentally, physically, emotionally, dancing ability; Stone Dick had it all. But he had to make a choice: does he leave it all behind to join one of those agencies, or does he say no to literally the most powerful people in the world? Stone Dick sat down with his mother and weighed his options.<p>
<p>
“Maybe this is a sign. I never thought of myself as a military man, but I did have the highest score in the history of the ASVAB test”, Stone Dick said to his mother.<p>
<p>
“Honey, you saved my life as an infant. A literal infant. I didn’t even need an epidural for your birth. You can do anything you put your mind to. Now do you want some more rice cakes?”.<p>
<p>
“I’ll have two more rice cakes. You’re right mom. Maybe this is the day Stone Dick Johnson becomes an American hero.” said Stone Dick.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick ate his rice cakes, which were slightly undercooked, and headed back to the living room where everyone was waiting for his decision.<p>
 “I’m joining NASA” proclaimed Stone Dick. The air went out of the room, as everyone who wasn’t a NASA representative starting destroying all the furniture and screaming expletives. It was a sad scene, seeing so many grown men hysterically crying. But NASA now<p>
had its most prized possession. <p>
<p>
Chapter 7<p>
<p>
&quot;The International Man of Mystery&quot; was his label, after being dubbed an honorary knight by the Queen and Austin Powers (Mike Myers).  Stone Dick had become a prime force to be reckoned with.<p>
<p>
As he grew older, he began to find to find jean jackets that weren't as baggy.  NASA reluctantly agreed to allow him to wear his jean jacket under his space suit.  Stone Dick believed he didn't need a suit anyways.<p>
<p>
The date was now July 18, 2005.  <p>
<p>
Stone Dick knew his mission ahead of him, but he needed a break, for he knew it was a dangerous one.  <p>
<p>
On that night of July 18, Stone Dick set out to find himself some ladies because well as you know now, Stone Dick loves him some ladies.  He went out to a bar with his buddy Fred Stevens, a rather normal fellow.  Stone Dick doesn't believe in the terminology of &quot;turned up.&quot;  He believes that one who says they get &quot;turned up&quot;, doesn't in actuality, get &quot;turned up&quot; at all.  On the other hand, Stone Dick doesn't speak about being &quot;turned up&quot;, he simply does.<p>
<p>
When Stone Dick was coming home after his intense session of persuasive Stone Dick loving, he realized, Fred had disappeared.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick realizing his friend was missing, pulled over a cab with his bare hand, removed the driver and drove back to the bar they were at.<p>
<p>
It seemed Stone Dick had arrived just in time.  Stone Dick had left Fred unattended, and the normal in Fred went away.  Fred had seemed to get into an argument with a black transexual.  She had become furious, and called forth all her exotic transexual friends.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick knew he had to do something.  He knew he could stop a bullet with his teeth, sharpen a knife with his penis, stick his balls in your wife's mouth and leave her with white teeth, but Stone Dick knew even he could not take on a bunch of angry transexuals.  The power of their anger is proven to sometimes amount to the strength of ten men and 2 elephants - Stone Dick knew not to fuck with that.<p>
<p>
So he did the only thing a real man can do when faced with such an unpleasant situation.<p>
<p>
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; he intervened.  They all looked at his chiseled features with drooling mouths.  <p>
<p>
&quot;I don't mean to be rude, but I just heard Caitlyn Jenner was at the Starbucks down the street!&quot;  <p>
<p>
In the blink of an instant, a herd of angry rhinoceroses could not have made a larger rumble than the footsteps of trampling transexuals on a warpath to meet their idol.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick, not being a liar, made a call to NASA.  NASA knowingly unhappy, but reluctantly realizing their need for Stone Dick, obliged and called the Kardashians.  <p>
<p>
Jenner arrived at Starbucks 40 minutes later.  Stone Dick had saved the day for Fred Stevens and a group of misunderstood transexuals.  The power of understanding strengthens the bonds between justice.<p>
<p>
The next day he woke up, got an astronautical spacecraft, and went to the moon - on 1 and half a hours sleep.  But that's a story for a different time.<p>
<p>
Chapter 8<p>
<p>
You could say Stone Dick was a busy man. He had a schedule that would make most men weep, but as you know by now, Stone Dick was not most men. Guys wanted to have a beer with him, girls wanted to rip his clothes off, and turtles wanted to be his friend. A man of such stature naturally gained a lot of enemies, but Stone Dick never seemed to mind. In his early 20’s, Stone Dick would almost meet his match. The key word in that sentence is ‘almost’, as you’ll soon find out.<p>
<p>
Mao Zedong was the 1st Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In other words, Mao Zedong was kind of an asshole. Many of you may be saying ‘what does the plight of the Chinese people have to do with Stone Dick, why didn’t he just mind his own business?’ My answer to you is that that is not the American way. If America sees something going on in another country you can bet your sweet ass we’re going to get involved and probably never leave, even if it meant thousands of people die because of it. That’s how Stone Dick operated as well. Anyway, back to Mr. Mao. During his reign, China suffered immensely. Millions of people died of famine, but Mao and his ridiculous haircut continued to prosper. Stone Dick caught wind of this news by reading the morning paper.<p>
<p>
“Hey Bridgette” Stone Dick yelled from across the room. “You ever heard of this Mao Zedong<p>
guy?”<p>
“Yeah” said Bridgette. “I think he cooked my pork fried rice the other night.”<p>
“No, no” said Stone Dick. “He’s the Communist leader of China or something. It says here he’s<p>
killing millions of his own people so his wallet can get fatter.”<p>
“Oh” said Bridgette. “Well he sure sounds like a son of a bitch, Stone. But you know that isn’t<p>
<p>
any of your business. You can’t just fly off the handle every time somebody does something terrible.”<p>
<p>
Stone Dick sat and took in Bridgette’s statement for a while, but eventually decided that he must do something to stop the reign of Communism.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick was on the next direct flight to Tokyo (I’m aware Tokyo is the capital of Japan. But Stone Dick had a hankering for some sushi, and no Communist dictator was going to stop him). After his sushi explosion, Stone Dick took the midnight train to Beijing, the capital of China. What he saw truly appalled him. People dying on the streets, businesses shut down and what was a once beautiful city was now no more. Stone Dick found the nearest payphone and looked up Mao Zedong’s address, but unfortunately for him, there were more Zedong’s in there than in a Chinese phonebook! <p>
<p>
After several very awkward encounters and one beautiful love making session, Stone Dick found his man. Stone kicked open the Communist leader’s front door and yelled ‘Mao! Get out here now and fight me like a man!’ Mao shuttered at the thought of fighting such a manly man, so he sent his goons after Stone Dick. He had no problems at first, but suddenly hundreds of henchmen appeared at once and the numbers began to prove too much for Stone Dick. Was this his final hour, his last stand?<p>
<p>
[Bullet noises]<p>
<p>
One by one the henchmen were dropping like Chinese flies. After a few minutes, Stone Dick was able to get the upper hand and take out the rest of Mao’s goons. After the last henchman was taken out, Stone Dick walked slowly up the steps towards Mao, who by this point had literally shit his pants.<p>
<p>
‘This one’s for China’ Stone Dick said softly, as he ripped Mao’s head clean off his shoulders. The Communist leader had been vanquished, and Stone Dick had come out on top again. But who was this mystery person who had helped him dispatch the henchmen? Stone Dick went outside but didn’t see anyone, until suddenly a bright light flashed in the distance. It was Mark Wahlberg, with his sniper rifle, riding a horse into the sunset.<p>
<p>
‘Fucking Mark Wahlberg” said Stone Dick.<p>
<p>
<p>
Chapter 9<p>
<p>
After taking down Communism, things slowed down for Stone Dick. He began to enjoy the little things in life: the erection of a butterfly, the gentle crispness of the breeze and the arch of a rainbow. He enjoyed the rough and tumble life of a human superhero, but after saving so many lives and having sex with so, so, so many women, he didn’t mind the change of pace. He bought a log cabin up in Saskatoon and lived the simple life. He was finally at peace, for once, it looked like things were going to stay that way. How wrong he was.<p>
<p>
ISIS, or Illegal Sexual Illegitimate Shitheads, began to terrorize the world. Raping’s, beheadings, assaults; you name it, ISIS was doing it. Their motives didn’t seem to materialize beyond bringing about the end of the world, so it made them a particularly tough foe to fight. They recruited men of all ages, including children, to spread their reign of terror. Whereas back in the day a soldier you were fighting against was clearly marked, ISIS operated in cowardly ways. They would strap bombs to children and blow up cities, go on social media and encourage lone wolf attacks and just generally be terrible people. By now you should know that the sentence that follows any description of ‘terrible people’ is going to include Stone Dick, and that’s exactly what happened.<p>

Under the codename Achmed, Stone Dick was leaving his simple log cabin life behind &amp; was recruited by the US military to take on ISIS. This was far and away the toughest task Stone Dick had ever undertaken, and he was going to need some help. After a few calls and some rather disturbing bribes, Stone Dick had his crew. Cross-Eyed Jim? Check. Bow legged Pete? You bet your ass he was there. Horace the Defiler? Unfortunately yes, he was also there. You see sometimes good vs. evil isn’t the game you have to play. Sometimes, just sometimes, you have to fight fire with fire. Sometimes you need to find the most deranged people you know and kick some terrorist ass.<p>
<p>
Stone Dick and Co. landed in Syria around 3am local time, and they wasted no time in laying waste to ISIS. Stone Dick used his superior speed to run circles around the human dumpster fires while lassoing them with barb wire. Just for shits and giggles, he gave them a taste of their own medicine and beheaded them with a bone saw. Horace the Defiler got to work shockingly quickly and took down 15 men alone with a sickle. What he did with those bodies afterwards is not going to put into print here. He raped them.<p>
<p>
Jim and Pete were the aviation experts, and they used their specially made drones with god<p>
damn machine guns on them to mow down hundreds of ISIS members. Stone Dick had taken control of the compound, but ISIS was much bigger than this compound. Their reach had expanded further than Stone Dick had ever thought, and he knew he had to call in the one favor he swore he never thought he’d need. It was time for Otto Van Jamstein to join the fight against ISIS.<p>
<p>
Chapter 10<p>
<p>
 Stone Dick knew only one place where he vanquished evil like Otto van Jamstein, and it wasn't hell or Mars.  Stone Dick began his expedition to NewFoundland.  Now, for those of you who don't know, NewFoundland is close to Iceland.  There are not many animals, certainly grizzly, and polarizing cold, and area where scum thrives. <p>
 Stone Dick arrived in NewFoundland in search of Otto.  He took Horace the Defiler with him because only evil could withstand the evils of Newfoundland; Peg Legged Pete, and CrossEyed Jim were too good for this trek.  Good men can only go so far into the depths of the unknown.  They waited behind as they were prepared to fight in Syria.  The moment Stone Dick and Horace stepped off the plane, an eerie silence swept the room.  Stone Dick, unafraid of the mountains of snow and an inevitable avalanche, screamed &quot;Otto, you bitch, lets go round 2!&quot;  You would of thought that someone summoned the damn.<p>
 Now normally in any story, does the hero ever seek out the villain after he has defeated the villain and vanquished him to Newfoundland.  However, if you haven't gotten the picture by now, the legend of Stone Dick, is not just any story.<p>
    <p>
 About 5 seconds later, the mountains began to shake like it had been affected by an early 2000s internet lag.  Then from yonder, came a strange cylinder like triangle that hovered slowly towards Horace and Stone Dick.  Horace began to shake, and began to start praying.  Now have you ever heard of a defiler seeking prayer? NO.  Imagine the circumstances. <p>
 Stone Dick stood his ground.  He knew that only one man's intellectual skill could build a hovering spacecraft in any area with no resources, no animals, and a lot of time - Otto.  <p>
<p>
&quot;Otto!&quot;  He exclaimed, as the hovering ship started moving faster.  &quot;Otto, I need your ...&quot;.  As Stone Dick muttered out the word “help”, Otto send forth a shrieking sound louder than a Mach 3 jet.  It pierced Stone Dick's ears.  Horace's ears were not as well equipped for the shriek, and he began to bleed out of his ears.  Stone Dick knew he would have to watch Horace die, and hold his ground at the same ... something they don't teach men - they teach gods. <p>
 As Horace continued bleeding out, Stone Dick stood his ground as the shriek got louder and louder. <p>
 &quot;Otto!&quot;  &quot;America's in trouble!&quot;  Stone Dick tried to shout over the shrieking.  His shouting had triggered an avalanche to begin.<p>
 &quot;I don't give a fuck about America!&quot;  wrote Otto on black piece of construction paper and white chalk, and stuck it to his window.<p>
 &quot;...But you give a fuck about your mom, don't you?!&quot;  Stone Dick stared at Otto through his tinted glass, as he showed no fear, and no effect from the loud shrieking Otto's Ingenious 500 Triangular HoverCraft 9000 was giving off.<p>
 Suddenly, the shrieking stopped.  Horace lay bleeding, but living and glad to be alive.  God had one final plan for him, this was not his time to die.<p>
 Otto, opened the window, and said to Stone Dick, as he could see that Stone Dick was no mere mortal, &quot;My mom is in trouble?&quot;<p>
 &quot;The whole world is Otto, they just attacked France, and now America is next.  Come with me, come fight the GOOD fight, BROTHER.&quot;<p>
 Otto, knowing Stone Dick saved his mom, knew this was his time to forgive and create a better life for himself, and of course, save his fucking mom, and maybe Stone Dick's mom too.<p>
 &quot;Viva La France!&quot; Otto replied, and at that very second, a special bond was formed between villain and foe, that you don't see in books, movies, life, reality, or even the quantum universe.  This bond could have formed the very existence of man, given it was just a few million years previous. <p>
 &quot;Long Live America!&quot;  replied Stone Dick. <p>
 There only lied one problem.  The impending avalanche was oncoming, and Stone Dick did not have any cardboard nearby.  As it rushed toward him, Otto swooped his Ingenious 500 Triangular HoverCraft 9000 and Stone Dick grabbed the bottom as Otto carried him away.  Horace latched on to Stone Dick's leg, and off they went.<p>
 &quot;To ISIS, Otto!&quot;  yelled Stone Dick. <p>
 Otto stepped on the gas, he knew there was no time to lose.  Next stop...Aleppo, Syria, the main headquarters of the Islamic State in Syria (ISIS).<p>
  <p>
Chapter 11<p>
<p>
Aleppo, Syria is a special kind of hell. Its mind numbingly hot, and what used to be a beautiful and historical country was now reduced to rubble thanks to ISIS. Although he had Otto, Horace, Pete and Jim, Stone Dick knew he was still a little outmatched. Luckily for him, fate was about to intervene. <p>
<p>
The WWE was running their annual Survivor Series pay per view in Atlanta, GA, and ISIS figured that would be the perfect assembly of innocent people for their next target. And that is the exact moment when ISIS made their most critical mistake. The WWE is run by Vincent Kennedy McMahon, undoubtedly one of those most successful and badass people in human history. The only thing Vinnie Mac loves more than wrestling is the US of mother fucking A, and the freedom that comes with being a US citizen. When Vince heard of ISIS threatening his pay per view, he decided to call in a few favors to help out the WWE's number one fan, Stone Dick.<p>
<p>
When Stone Dick arrived into Aleppo, he felt fear for the first time but was ready for the challenge ahead. Thankfully for him, his luck was about to change. As he stepped off of the HoverCraft, an almost endless line of beer cans awaited him. Stone Dick was confused, but he followed the trail of empty beers to a random tent with a WWE flag on it. His confusion turned to elation as he opened the tent, and Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock were sitting there drinking beers.<p>
&quot;Are you..&quot; - said Stone Dick<p>
&quot;Yup&quot; - said Stone Cold and The Rock simultaneously. &quot;We heard you needed some help beating ISIS, so Vince gave us a call and here we are. This place is a real shit-hole, though.&quot;<p>
&quot;It's not great guys, but man it's great to see you!&quot; said Stone Dick. &quot;ISIS has done enough terrorizing. It's time to kick some terrorist ass.&quot;<p>
Stone Dick, Stone Cold, The Rock and the rest of the Sexaholics hopped into a helicopter and were on their way to once and for all end ISIS.<p>
Although they were out manned, they made up for their lack of numbers with gigantic balls. Literally. Before Stone Dick headed out to Syria, he met with Dr. Neil Huling, one of the most distinguished medical professionals in his field. Dr. Huling created 10 pairs of large testicles that could be stitched to each man’s FUPA region. Inside these large testicles were everything a fighter would need: adrenaline, smelling salts, morphine, beer and a large stash of Hostess Twinkies. Once these testicles were attached to the fighter’s body, they were able to control them with the power of their minds. This was to be their secret weapon against the terrorists. Or so the terrorists thought…<p>
At this point, the time for words were over, and the time for fighting was now. The Sexaholics, led by Stone Dick, Stone Cold and The Rock, landed in the heart of ISIS controlled Syria and began to do battle. It was a bloody, tiring battle, but one that Stone Dick knew he had to win. <p>
<p>
Otto controlled the action early, slicing and dicing his way through the terrorist scum. His sword, aptly nicknamed ‘The Dicer’, was mowing through ISIS like a knife through a hot Cinnabon. Horace, Pete and Jim went with the triple team approach, and it proved successful at first. Horace’s special numb chucks turned into Daddy’s Special Murder Weapon as they decimated the foes. Pete and his peg leg-machine gun made quick work of the first onslaught of ISIS members as well. Now normally we’d finish this off with a funny line about Cross Eyed Jim, but if there’s one thing that works against you in the field of battle, its being cross eyed. Unfortunately for Jim, he became terrorist stew in a matter of moments as he literally could not see where the enemy was coming from. The Sexaholics were now down to 6, and it would quickly shrink to just four when Pete’s peg leg was knocked out from under and he shot Horace the Defiler right in the in the dick. Pete was executed and Horace was carried away by ISIS. <p>
<p>
Stone Dick, Stone Cold, The Rock and Otto continued to fend off ISIS, but the numbers game began to cause some serious issues. Each of them had already used all the adrenaline and Twinkies in their testicles, and what was once a valiant effort now seemed futile. Not only did ISIS have them outnumbered, but the weather was clearly an advantage for the terrorists as well. The abrasive heat and sweltering winds were taking their toll on the freedom fighters, and just when things couldn’t get any worse, Abdullah the Butcher came roaring towards them. <p>
<p>
Abdullah the Butcher is the most feared ISIS fighter of all, tallying up a reported head count in the thousands. This was the sign Stone Dick was looking for, and he immediately radioed to an unknown ally, ordering Stone Cold, The Rock and Otto to retreat. Out of the dark abyss came a helicopter, which swooped in, gathered the four brave men and flew away. ISIS stood on the ground, befuddled yet cheerful, believing they vanquished and caused retreat of another Western enemy. How wrong they were. <p>
<p>
Driving the helicopter was none other than Charlie Sheen, who just so happened to be fresh out of the hospital after a full body blood transfusion. Stone Cold, The Rock and Otto looked to Stone Dick for the next move, as they couldn’t believe they retreated. Fortunately for them, Stone Dick had one last trick up his sleeve.<p>
“Charlie, drop the bomb baby!” exclaimed Stone Dick.<p>
“You got it, boss!” said Charlie.<p>
As all the ISIS members, including Abdullah the Butcher, cheered on the ground below, an atomic bomb filled with Charlie Sheen’s HIV infected blood mixed with chemical weapons dropped on top of them. Stone Dick’s plan, which was to get all the major ISIS generals in one confined area, worked like a charm. ISIS was defeated, and Stone Dick was heading home to have sex with so many fine women.<p>
(If you’re wondering what happened to Horace the Defiler after he was taken away by ISIS, he died. Don’t’ feel bad, he was a Defiler.)<p>
<p>
<p>
Chapter 12<p>
<p>
America needed a superhero.  It had men like Mark Wahlberg, Stone Cold, The Rock, and Dan Bilzerian.  Stone Dick was bigger than that.<p>
Now in a moment when the people of America really understood the magnitude of Stone Dick's accomplishments, they greeted his return home with the utmost respect.<p>
Stone Dick was greeted upon arrival in a nearly resource depleted Ingenuous 5000 to loads of beautiful naked women.  But Stone Dick knew his job was not complete.<p>
&quot;Take the girls, boys&quot; he said to the Sexaholics. &quot;Show them a good time.  I have two things left to do.”<p>
Now, Stone Dick wasn’t alluding to sex, just a good time, in case it was thought that these men cheated on their lovely wives.  Now, threesomes, threesomes are a whole different thing.  That's why Stone Dick has orgies, he doesn't believe in society's possessive culture.<p>
Journalists were waiting outside for Stone Dick.  He called one in the room, Peter Parker, to give a statement about the destruction of ISIS.  He knew Parker was a good man, and also possibly a Superhero.<p>
Stone Dick was brief.  &quot;ISIS is destroyed for now.  Watch out for their children, we must separate the children and teach them what is right and that destruction is wrong. Respect Charlie Sheen.  He's half gay.  So what?  He saved America, not me.  Charlie is a true hero.&quot;<p>
Parker would deliver the truthful message to the American people, but Stone Dick had one final thing to do, and he was headed there:  The Presidential Debates.<p>
While Donald Trump was busy putting his foot in his mouth and every other viable Presidential candidate was busy debating over whether or not they would kill baby Hitler, Stone Dick had another thing on his mind: waffles. Stone Dick loved him some waffles, and not even a Presidential debate invite was going to stop him from getting some. So he stopped at Waffle House, ordered his usual dozen waffles with a side of brown sugar, and began to dig in. What happened next would change the course of human history.<p>
As Stone Dick was eating his waffles, a man in a yellow shirt, tie and hat walked into the Waffle House. He sat down across from Stone Dick, who was thoroughly confused, but also kind of happy, because Curious George was favorite book.<p>
“Can I help you?” – said Stone Dick<p>
“How would you like to change the world, son?” said the man in the yellow hat.<p>
“To be honest sir, I think I’ve done enough world changing lately. I’m just here for the waffles. “ said Stone Dick.<p>
“Come with me” said the man in the yellow hat. “I want to show you something. And for the record, it is not my dick.”<p>
Stone Dick begrudgingly scoffed down the rest of his waffles and followed the man in the yellow hat towards what looked like an abandoned building near the Waffle House. When he got inside, Stone Dick quickly realized this was not a normal abandoned building. What awaited him instead were thousands of TV’s, each broadcasting from a different part of the globe. The man in the yellow hat took off his hat, only to reveal a smaller yellow hat underneath, which made Stone Dick chuckle.<p>
“What is this place?” said Stone Dick.<p>
“This is the place where things happen” said the man in the now smaller yellow hat. “This is where we run the world”. Just as the man in the yellow hat said that sentence, ‘Who Run the World’ by Beyoncé started blaring over the speakers. “Sorry about that” said the man in the yellow hat. “We’re still working out some glitches”.<p>
“Well now that I know what this place is” said Stone Dick, “I guess my next question is: why am I here?”<p>
“Ah the million dollar question” said the man in the yellow hat. “For the past two decades, we have been secretly changing the world, little by little, all from this room. All the TV screens here are used to monitor world events, and we think we’re finally ready to launch our final project. You see Stone Dick, there are too many crazy world leaders out there, and judging by the candidates for the next election, they’re not getting any less crazy. That’s why we want to create one supreme leader to rule the entire planet. And we want that person to be you. What do you say?”<p>
Stone Dick, still amazed by what he was seeing and hearing, tried to comprehend what was being asked of him. After thinking it over quickly, he walked over to one of the TVs, where Donald Trump was spanking an illegal immigrant with a tree branch while a crowd of white people cheered on. And then, Stone Dick finally spoke:<p>
“I think I’m going to need more waffles.”<p>
<p>
